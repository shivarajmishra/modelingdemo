Dimensions:
	agecategory is per age in groups 0-19, 20-44, 45+, but where 0-19 is always zero so the row is omitted.

Direct inputs.
	cs                /agecategory
	nscv              /agecategory
	cscv              /agecategory

Parameter inputs.
	totalFSFV         /agecategory
	totalFSCV         /agecategory
	totalNSFV         /agecategory

Derivations:

ns such that the rows sum to 1.

Tunnels states are populated /age as follows, using QSQV_x as an example:
 * Let S be the set {state_1, stat_2, ..., state_(age - 19)}.
 * Split the value totalFSFV uniformly between the states in S.
 * Set QSQV_x to state_x, if state_x exists, otherwise set it to 0, for all x.
 * Set FSFV to the sum of state_n for n >= 20.
Note that we populate up to state_(age - 19) because totalFSFV may be non-zero for age 20, so S must be nonempty or we would lose mass.
