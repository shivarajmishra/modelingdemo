agecategory X means ages X to X+4

Generate age cohorts 2,7,12,17,...97,102,107

 - Sum cs and cscv in prevalence.csv to get total smoking prevalence.
 - If my age is less than 20,
	Assume starting year 0 and use dataFilePre.csv for the youngest cohort of this sex by strata.
Otherwise
	Use the prevelance to look up the appropriate dataFilePre.csv. Match the value to totalSmoke to get a starting year.
 - Copy the next 21 entries to the appropriate age cohort in dataFile.csv.
 - Reindex dataFile.csv from age cohorts and year since simulation start, to what happens to people of particular ages per year.
 - Write cs.csv and cscv.csv with these reindexed values.

So eg.
 - year 0 for 52 year olds is written in year_start 0, agecategory 50 because they are 52
 - year 1 for 52 year olds is written in year_start 1, agecategory 50 because they are 53
 - year 2 for 52 year olds is written in year_start 2, agecategory 50 because they are 54
 - year 3 for 52 year olds is written in year_start 3, agecategory 55 because they are 55
 - year 4 for 52 year olds is written in year_start 4, agecategory 55 because they are 56
 - year 5 for 52 year olds is written in year_start 5, agecategory 55 because they are 57

Problems.
 - Rows of cs.csv and cscv.csv cannot sum to more than 1.
 - Values in cs.csv and cscv.csv cannot be negative.
